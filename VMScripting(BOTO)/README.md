To use this scripts we need access_key_id, secret_access_key and endpoint, which we can get 
from CCC2017-Team18-x509/ ec2rc.sh. 

First, we create a key using key.py and we are using default security group for port 
configuration. and after that, we can launch instances using launch_instance.py. 
we can check launched instances information using print_instance_info.py
