To use this ansible file we need ansible and all dependent packages 
installed in our system,  beauty of ansible is we don't have to install 
ansible on remote host where we want to install all packages and software.

We have used ansible to install MongoDB and docker on nectar instances. 
Also, we are deploying docker containers there using ansible. It 
automatically pulls images from docker cloud which is pushed there by us.

ansible.cfg file has all configuration of ansible.
