The indices reflect the ease or difficulty people face accessing basic services within metropolitan areas, and is based on the measurement of road distances people travel to reach different services. Metro ARIA is a composite index which combines accessibility measures for five different service themes: (1) Education; (2) Health; (3) Shopping; (4) Public Transport; and (5) Financial/Postal services. Metro ARIA and each of the service theme sub-indices have been calculated at SA1 level and classified into five accessibility levels graded from low to high, a numeric and text description of each class is included, and are available for viewing and analysis within the AURIN portal. Metro ARIA is based on the Accessibility/ Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA)  methodology which focuses on quantifying remoteness in non-metropolitan areas. ARIA+ is widely accepted as Australia's most authoritative geographic measure of remoteness, used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the Remoteness Area classification since 2001.
